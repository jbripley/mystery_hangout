Mystery Hangout
===============

Shake your phone and it will look up hangouts listed on Hyves near your position. 
It then randomly selects one of them and shows directions to it.

This application was built during a hackthon at Hyves[1] during the Kings of Code[2]
conference.

This application is using the hyves private experimental api method called 
hubs.getBySpatialRadiusMostPopulair[3] that hyves was kindly to open up for our 
api key. If you want to fork this app they will probably do the same for you.
