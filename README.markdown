Mystery Hangout
===============

Shake your phone and it will look up hangouts listed on Hyves near your position. 
It then randomly selects one of them and shows directions to it. Demo of the app
is available [here][1].

This application was built during a hackthon at [Hyves][2] during the 
[Kings of Code][3] conference by [@nollbit][4] [@jbripley][5] and [@johanni][6].

This application is using the hyves private experimental api method called 
[hubs.getBySpatialRadiusMostPopulair][7] that hyves was kindly to open up for our 
api key. If you want to fork this app they will probably do the same for you.
